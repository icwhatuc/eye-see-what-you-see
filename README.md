# eye-see-what-you-see

This is a small portion of the work for a senior project at the Cooper Union from 2012-2013.  The goal of the project was to take a simple webcam, few infrared LEDs, and with some of the code here be able to determine where individuals distanced upto 5-7 feet away were gazing on a large display.  The potential applications we had in mind were advertising, aiding handicapped individuals, and classroom analytics for educators.
